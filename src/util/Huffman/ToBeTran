An interface that can be used to allow MutableAttributeSet implementations to use pluggable attribute compression techniques.
Each mutation of the attribute set can be used to exchange a previous AttributeSet instance with another,
preserving the possibility of the AttributeSet remaining immutable.
An implementation is provided by the StyleContext class.
The Element implementations provided by this class use this interface to provide their MutableAttributeSet implementations,
so that different AttributeSet compression techniques can be employed.
The method getAttributeContext should be implemented to return the object responsible for implementing the desired compression technique.z
